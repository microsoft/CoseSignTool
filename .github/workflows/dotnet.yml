#### Build, Test, and Publish ####
# This is the main workflow for the CoseSignTool project. It handles the following events:
#   - Pull requests: When a user submits a pull request, or pushes a commit to an existing pull request, this workflow 
#       - generates a changelog and commits it to the working branch, and then 
#       - builds and tests the code.
#   - Pushes to the main branch: When a user pushes a commit to the main branch, this workflow
#       - creates a semantically versioned tag,
#       - creates a release with the new tag, and then
#       - triggers the release portion of the workflow.
#   - Releases: When a user creates a release, or a release is created in response to a push event, this workflow
#       - builds, publishes, and zips the outputs, and then
#       - uploads the zipped assets to the release.

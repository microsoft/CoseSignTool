# CoseSignTool
CoseSignTool is a platform-independent command line application to COSE sign files, validate COSE signatures, and optionally retrieve the content from COSE embed-signed files. 
It supports three commands: **Sign**, **Validate**, and **Get**.

## Concepts to know before you start
* **Payload**: We use the term "Payload" to describe the content that is or will be signed. This might be a file or an object in memory.
* **Detached vs. Embedded**: By default, CoseSignTool produces a detached signature, which is separate from the file or stream containing the payload. Both the signature and the original payload must be present for validation. An embedded signature is where a copy of the payload is inserted into the signature structure as a byte array. An embedded signature may be validated without the orginal payload present, but is not readable in a text editor. The CoseSignTool "get" command retrieves the payload and writes it to file or console.

## Sign
The **Sign** command signs a file or stream.

You will need to specify:
* The payload content to sign. This may be a file specified with the **/Payload** option or you can pipe it in on the Standard Input channel when you call CoseSignTool. Piping in the content is generally considered more secure and performant option but large streams of > 2gb in length are not yet supported.
* A certificate to sign with. You can either use the **/Thumbprint** option to pass the SHA1 thumbprint of an installed certificate or use the **/PfxCertificate** option to point to a .pfx certificate file and a **/Password** to open the certificate file with if it is locked. The certificate must include a private key.

You may also want to specify:
* Detached or embedded: By default, CoseSignTool creates a detached signature, which contains a hash of the original payoad. If you want it embedded, meaning that the signature file includes a copy of the payload, use the **/EmbedPayload option.** Note that embedded signatures are only supported for payload of less than 2gb.
* Where to write the signature to. You have three ways to go here:
    1. Write to the Standard Output channel (STDOUT) / console by using the **/PipeOutput** option.
    1. Specify an output file with **/SignatureFile**
    1. Let CoseSignTool decide. It will write to *payload-file*.cose for detached or *payload-file*.csm for embedded signatures. But if you don't specify a payload file at all, it will exit with an error.
* What certificate store to use. If you passed in a thumbprint instead of a .pfx certificate, CoseSignTool will assume that certificate is in the default store (My/CurrentUser on Windows) unless you tell it otherwise. Use the **/StoreName** and **/StoreLocation** options to specify a store.
>Pro tip: Certificate store operations run faster if you use a custom store containing only the certificates you will sign with. You can create a custom store by adding a certificate to a store with a unique Store Name and pre-defined Store Location. For example, in Powershell: 
~~~
Import-Certificate -FilePath 'c:\my\cert.pfx' -CertStoreLocation 'Cert:CurrentUser\MyNewStore'
~~~

Run *CoseSignTool sign /?* for the complete command line usage.

## Validate
The **Validate** command validates that a COSE signature is properly constructed, matches the signed payload, and roots to a valid certificate chain.

You will need to specify:
* What to validate. This may be a file specified with the **/SignatureFile** option or you can pipe it in on the Standard Input channel when you call CoseSignTool. Piping in the content is generally considered more secure and performant option but large streams of > 2gb in length may be truncated, depending on what operating system and command shell you use.
* (For detached and indirect signatures only) the **/Payload** that was signed. If validating an embedded signature, skip this part.

You may also want to specify:
* Some root certificates. By default, CoseSignTool will try to chain the signing certificate to whatever certificates are installed on the machine. If you want to chain to certificates that are not installed, use the **/Roots** option.
    * User-specified roots will be treated as "trusted" for purposes of validation.
    * Root certificates for validation do not have to include a private key, so .cer files are acceptable.
    * To supply multiple root certificates, separate the file paths with commas.
* Certificate Details. You can use the */ShowCertificateDetails** option to print out the details of the signing certificate chain.
* Verbosity. You can use the */Verbose** option to get more detailed output on validation failures.

And in some cases:
* **/RevocationMode** -- By default, CoseSignTool checks the signing certificate against an online database to see if it has been revoked. You can skip this check by setting **/RevocationMode** to **none**. RevocationMode.Offline is not yet implemented.
* **/CommonName** -- Forces validation to require that the signing certificate match a specific Common Name value.
* **/AllowUntrusted** -- Prevents CoseSignTool from failing validation when the certificate chain has an untrusted root. This is intended for test purposes and should not generally be used for production.

Run *CoseSignTool validate /?* for the complete command line usage.

## Get
The **Get** command retrieves the payload from a COSE embed-signed file and writes the text to cosole or to a file. It also runs the Validate command and prints out any errors on the Standard Error pipe.

You will need to specify:
* What to validate. This may be an embed-signed file specified with the **/SignatureFile** option or you can pipe it in on the Standard Input channel when you call CoseSignTool.

You may also want to specify:
* A file to write the payload to. Use the **/SaveTo** option to specify a file path; otherwise the payload will be printed to Standard Out.
* **/Roots**, **/Verbosity**, **/RevocationMode**, **/CommonName**, and **/AllowUntrusted**, exactly as with the Validate command.

Run *CoseSignTool get /?* for the complete command line usage.
